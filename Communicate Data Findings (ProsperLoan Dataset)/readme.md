# (Prosper Loan Dataset)
## by (Omar Sherif)


## Dataset

The Prosper Loan Dataset consists of  113,937 loans (observations) with 81 variables on each 
loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), 
current loan status, borrower income, and many others. From my understanding of the dataset 
I have chosen some variable to support me in my investigation 
such as Term ,LoanStatus ,BorrowerAPR ,BorrowerRate ,EmploymentStatus ,IsBorrowerHomeowner 
,OpenCreditLines ,BankcardUtilization and The 113937 observations are reduced after cleaning to be 83526 observation


## Summary of Findings

The Prosper rating and Prosper Score variables seems to look as a normal distribution 
and also the Prosper Score looks as a multimodal distribution as there are 3 peeks 
, The Distribution of OpenCreditLines seems to be Right-Skewed and 
the Distribution of BorrowerRate and BorrowerAPR variables are almost normal distributed and
We can conclude that people who owns home tends to have higher ProsperScore on average 
, and we can also see that as the ProsperRating increases the BorrowerRate decreases on average , 
and also people that has term 12 tends to have higher ProsperScore median than other terms 
, we can also conclude that people with Full time employment status have the higher ProsperScore median 
compared to other employment status , finally we also concluded that at higher Prosper rating the Borrower
 may have more OpenCreditLines and we can see that people who owns home and works us a full time 
have the highest ProsperScore median and that make sense and also we can conclude that people 
with current loan status their average prosperscore increases when the term increases 
while people with completed loan status are exactly the opposite and finnaly
 that there are a very strong negative correlation between ProsperRating and BorrowerAPR




## Key Insights for Presentation

I tried to find the most appropiate plots for each of my findings and followed the high data ink ratio rule
and simple colors in order to make the plots clear and readible . Also to emphasize my findings I tried to
find out all the relationships between the variables and the main features which are ProsperScore and ProsperRating 
by using different plots and univariate and bivariate and multivariate plots
